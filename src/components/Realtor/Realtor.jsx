              methodologies. Starting with the smallest possible component(or
              atoms) and building more complex components(or organisms) from
              there. We had 3 Design System Meetings(DSM) a week to discuss
              component and system requirements. We would ask questions like:

            <ul>
              <Body as="li" mb={3}>
                Is this component necessary? Does one already exist in another
                form? If so can we push back and the designer can use the
                component that already exists to solve the problem. Less is
                more!

                What are the requirements of this component and how could it be
                customized? Are we building something that is scalable or
                trapping ourselves with a component that is too specific?

              After 12 months the RDC-UI component library was widely used and
              we received much positive feedback on the ease of use and time
              saving it had on developers tasks. It freed up developers to work
              on the features with comfort in knowing that the components that
              they were using were to spec and fully supported by a dedicated
              team of developers.
